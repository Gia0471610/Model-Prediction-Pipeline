# Model-Prediction-Pipeline
## OVERVIEW
1. Using PyCaret for classification tasks, from setting up the environment, training and evaluating models, making predictions, and visualizing model performance.
2. Using scikit-learn to build and evaluate a logistic regression model using a pipeline. 
3. Using Yellowbrick to performs model evaluation and prediction pipeline.


## DATA
The data is from Kaggle "GooglePlayStore.csv", which is a dataset that contains information about mobile apps available on the Google Play Store. The dataset typically includes information such as app name, category, rating, number of reviews, size, installs, type (free or paid), price, content rating, genre, last updated date, and current version of the app.
